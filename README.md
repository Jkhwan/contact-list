### Lighthouse Labs Week 3 Day 1 Assignment - Contact List

##### The purpose is to build a ruby command line application for managing user contacts through a REPL interface.

This is our first project built in an object oriented way. The user will be able to create, list, find, and show all contacts from the main menu. They are also allowed to edit a particular entry, and add multiple phone numbers to each contact. Finally, persistence of the contacts is implemented by saving and loading all contact information from a CSV file.
